### SQL References
**Q**

*Query* - The basic construct to communicate with any SQL server. Queries can call information, add, uodate, and delete. Queries can also manipulate information using algorithms, and connect references. Queries can be single use or saved for repeated use.

**T**

*Table* - A data structure containing raw data in the forms of text, numbers, dates, booleans (true/false), and even JSON (secondary data structures). This is where data is directly stored.

**V**

*View* - A structured query that is accessible similarly to a table. Information is not stored in a view, but can be pulled like a table into Excel, Google AppSheet, and other sources. References, algorithems, and root calls can be used in a view, but cannot be changed later.
